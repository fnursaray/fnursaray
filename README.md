- Hi, Iâ€™m @fnursaray ðŸŒ¸
- In recent years, I have turned my interest in technology and software into a professional pursuit. Embracing the mindset of continuous learning and growth, I try to keep my technical knowledge and skills up to date every day. While working on projects, I make a conscious effort to research and incorporate the latest versions of the technologies I use. Throughout the project process, I deal with the challenges associated with my problem-solving abilities, finding practical and efficient solutions. For the rest of my life, I am determined to keep moving forward in this field.
